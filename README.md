# VulneraScan

**VulneraScan** is a lightweight web vulnerability scanning tool that helps users perform basic reconnaissance and identify common security issues like **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. It integrates with **Google Gemini AI** to generate markdown-formatted security summaries based on scan results.

---

## What It Does

VulneraScan checks for:

- Basic **reconnaissance** data (WHOIS, DNS, headers)
- **SQL injection** vulnerabilities by testing simple payloads
- **XSS vulnerabilities** using reflected payload detection
- AI-generated **summary reports** in Markdown format using Google Gemini API

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Python** (FastAPI)
- **Google Gemini API** for AI summarization

### Frontend

- **React (Vite)**
- **Chakra UI**
- **Appwrite** (for authentication only)

---

## Features

- Reconnaissance data collection (WHOIS, DNS, headers)
- SQLi testing with basic payloads
- XSS reflected input testing
- AI-generated security summary reports (`.md` format)
- Downloadable summary file
- Clean UI with Chakra UI
- No database dependency
- Appwrite authentication (optional)
